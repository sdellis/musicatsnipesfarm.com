We believe\n      that our liberation is rooted in a community where all people are valued\n      equally. So instead of upholding a hierarchical model of operation, this\n      collective is a collaborative and egalitarian experiment that you are\n      invited to join. There are some core concepts and guiding values at the\n      foundation of this project, some taken directly from adrienne marie brown’s\n      <em>Emergent Strategy</em>.\n      <ul>\n        <li>Capitalism has failed us.</li>\n        <li>Liberation is rooted in community care.</li>\n        <li>Making art is a pathway to fulfillment and freedom.</li>\n        <li>Small is good, small is all.

The pandemic has amplified its failings, and has more clearly revealed its related structures of inequity and colonial artifacts. But what is the best, fairest alternative? We will find out. Soupçon allows us to experiment with alternative ways of living and interacting. This is a social experiment that aims to prove that more compassionate societies are not only possible, but can thrive. This is not to say that we will get everything right, and we will most certainly need to adjust the dials along the way.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      We value collaboration, accountability, diversity, and joy. We work to uplift and center the most vulnerable among us. Consistent government failings and pandemic-imposed isolation have exacerbated the divisions among us. We want to see this end. There is no savior that will swoop in and make things better. We have only ourselves and we embark on this journey out of love for our families, our friends, and our community. Soupçon is a city-wide commune that will teach us to work together, in harmony.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <section id=\"mutual_aid\">\n    <h2>Mutual Aid</h2>\n    <p>\n    Luckily, we do have some promising guides as we set out to create a better society.\n    In 2020, Dean Spade published\n    <a href=\"http://www.deanspade.net/mutual-aid-building-solidarity-during-this-crisis-and-the-next/\">\n    a book on practical organizing</a> called <em>Mutual Aid: Building Solidarity\n    During This Crisis (And The Next)</em>. Spade defines \"mutual aid\" as collective coordination\n    to meet each other's needs, usually from an awareness that the systems we have in place\n    are not going to meet them. We see examples of mutual aid in every single social movement,\n    whether it's raising money for workers on strike, putting drinking water in the desert for\n    migrants crossing the border, or coordinating letter-writing to prisoners. These are mutual\n    aid projects. They directly meet people's survival needs, and are based on a shared\n    understanding that the conditions in which we are made to live are unjust.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Today, many of us live in the most atomized societies in human history, which makes our\n    lives less secure and undermines our ability to organize together to change unjust\n    conditions on a larger scale. We are put into competition with each other for survival,\n    and we are forced to rely on hostile systems for the things we need. In this context, mutual aid --\n    where we choose to help each other out, share things, and put time and resources into caring\n    for the most vulnerable -- is a radical act. It's how we build solidarity and enable real\n    positive change to take root and grow.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <section id=\"beneficiary_society\">\n    <h2>Why a Non-profit?</h2>\n    <p>Soupçon Salon is a Nonprofit Corporation that falls under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3). Many people instinctively pit mutual aid networks and nonprofits against each other, but we don't believe that every nonprofit is part of the \"nonprofit industrial complex.\" Instead, we believe that there is a place for self-aware nonprofits to provide needed support to mutual aid groups and to collaborate in bringing about about real change. Where philanthropy builds ties between people and organizations, we seek to encourage relationships among people, and expand our community's capacity to give back and improve our collective lot.\n    </p>\n    <p>Charity, aid, relief, and social services are terms that usually refer to rich people or the government making decisions about the provision of some kind of support for poor people -- that is, rich people or the government deciding who gets the help, and what strings are attached. You can be sure that help like that is not designed to get to the root causes of poverty and violence. It's designed to help improve the image of the elites who are funding it and put a tiny, inadequate bandage on the massive social wound that their greed creates. No, Soupçon is not a charity.\n    </p>\n    <p>What is it then?</p>\n    <p>\n      Soupçon Salon mobilizes neighbors who have good ideas to become powerful citizen leaders who plan, fund and make positive “in our backyards” - the positive opposite of NIMBY. The only requirement for membership/partnership with Soupçon Salon is that you must agree with our deining principle, which is:\n      <blockquote>\"We unite people with the common goals of working on collective excellence and facilitating a voluntary reciprocal exchange of resources and services for mutual benefit.\"</blockquote>\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <section id=\"involvement\">\n    <h2>Partnership</h2>\n    <p>Although the terms are interchangeable, we specifically call people in our society <em>partners,</em> not <em>members,</em> for two reasons. The word <em>“member”</em> sounds both too exclusive and too passive. Soupçon is inclusive and partners are expected to be active participants in the creating the society they want to see. In other words, partners are expected to get their hands dirty once in a while. Working toward utopia is hard work, but we can do it together.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <section id=\"involvement--partner-benefits\">\n    <h3>Partner Benefits</h3>\n    <p>\n      Partners pay yearly dues of $120 ($10/month) to join, and can sign up on the website or by\n      visiting the cafe. The dues are used to make sure operations go smoothly,\n      to pay the rent, and to maintain equipment and property.\n      It can also be used to fund projects and additional partner benefits.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Partners currently receive many benefits:\n    </p>\n      <h4>Inclusive First</h4>\n      <p>\n        Not that we see it as a \"benefit,\" since inclusivity should simply be the way things are. We design our systems of living with a commitment to including all. We work together to dismantle internalized systems of oppression and keep each other accountable. We support and center our most vulnerable and our most oppressed members of the community and society at large. We support a vegan and compassionate vegetarian menu to fight climate change and to reduce suffering in the world.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Access to The Facility</h4>\n      <p>\n        Partners are able to gain access and host meetings and events at the historic and beautiful Hibernia Firehouse. This is a chill space. All are welcome. The music is local. The projects are fresh. The upstairs lounge is a relaxing sanctuary with wi-fi and air conditioning ready for work, organizing, or socializing.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Support Network</h4>\n      <p>Soupçon seeks to offer direct assistance to those experiencing life difficulties.\n        In a time when many people don't have other places to turn, Soupçon will listen\n        to community needs. We will work to meet those needs and support the well-being of our community.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Artists and Craftspeople Showcases</h4>\n      <p>\n      The walls are for local art. How that will be done will be up to those who\n      get involved in shaping the gallery.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Teaching/Instruction</h4>\n      <p>\n      A big part of working together is teaching other people how to do things.\n      Partners are encouraged to host a class on anything useful, creative, or\n      empowering. This could be how to build websites, knit hats, figure drawing in watercolor,\n      or make baskets out of materials from the path along the canal, or whatever!\n      Let's share our skills!\n      </p>\n      <h4>Musician/Performer Showcases</h4>\n      <p>\n      If you have ever performed in this space, you know there is magic. We intend to\n      hold weekly, curated events at Soupçon Salon in the model of the original event,\n      and we would love all the local musicians to have a chance to shine in front\n      of their neighbors. These events will be recorded and live-streamed to RadioFreeLambertville.com.\n      Attendees are encouraged to contribute a tip to the performer.\n      </p>\n      <p></p>\n      <p>\n      We have a PA and a space large enough for a 3-4 piece band\n      or 4 musicians if we want to reach the maximum capacity of 35. And of course,\n      there is always open mic night.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Guidance and Leadership</h4>\n      <p>\n      We're all in this experiment together. We need to meet to make decisions and\n      resolve issues. We need to adapt as new partners come in with fresh ideas\n      and as conditions inevitably change. How do we do this without hierarchy?\n      </p>\n      <p>Partner meetings take place in person once a month, with an option for remote\n        participation. All partners have a say in\n        our path forward, and decisions are made via consensus. As the group\n        becomes larger, we will create teams that work on short or long-term projects\n        and report back or submit proposals to the larger group. Decisions are transparent and\n        made in accordance with the process defined by the group.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The first team we must create is a \"Board of Directors,\" which is required by the IRS.\n        The Soupçon Board of Directors make operational or administrative decisions to\n        keep the organization running. In contrast to more passive and hierarchical organizations,\n        the Soupçon Board of Directors does not have the power to make certain decisions without the\n        larger group's approval. It will be up to the society to decide which\n        decisions require consensus among the larger group.\n      </p>\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <section id=\"involvement--partner-skills\">\n <h3>How Can I Help?</h3>\n  <p>We have no shortage of work to make this happen. No one partner should be\n    taking on a majority of the work. Come out to our monthly partners meeting and get involved! At the very least,   subscribe to our mailing list below if you are interested in learning more and possibly\n    being involved in this creative act. Soupçon is a space for all of us\n    to grow together.\n  </p>\n</section>\n  </article>\n  <aside class=\"sidebar-right\">\n    <nav class=\"section-nav\">\n      <ol>\n        <li><a href=\"#how_it_works\">How It Works</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"#why\">Why Are We Doing This?</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"#mutual_aid\">Mutual Aid</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"#beneficiary_society\">Why a Nonprofit?</a>\n        <li><a href=\"#involvement\">Partnership</a>\n          <ul>\n            <li class=\"\"><a href=\"#involvement--partner-benefits\">Partner Benefits</a></li>\n            <li class=\"\"><a href=\"#involvement--partner-skills\">How Can I Help?</a></li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </nav>\n  </aside>\n\n</Layout>\n",null]}
